About Project:
-------------

This website was inspired by a few questions I found around on different websites of people looking for a basic website for a FiveM server, Well thats what I did over the past few weeks,
I decided to build this website which is a simple site that even basic coders can understand, I will be bringing more updates out! (Check Future Plans At Bottom for more info on my plans),

Do you have a suggestion? Let me know!
